Hey there, I'm Dan, a software developer, entrepreneur and musician. I've been coding for about 20 years with the last 9 years spent predominantly around the Ruby programming language. My intention is for the articles here to help developers become better at dealing with people and to understand business and what drives it.

Let me know how I can help you, hit me up at dan@dmuso.com.
