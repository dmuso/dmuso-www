As a professional developer, you probably have experience in a few different languages. You will know from your experience that programming languages have strengths and weaknesses. No single language is the ideal solution for all types of problems. A time will come in your career where you see an opportunity to introduce a new programming language that isn't already in use within your team. Here are some of the issues you may come across and how to overcome them.

Things to overcome:
* The "trendiness" factor
* team leads and managers
* demonstrating business value/cost savings
* operations
* hiring/skillsets


## The "trendiness" factor

Things move fast in the technology sector, and new programming langugages are continually being invented. An interesting dynamic seems to occur within the developer community when new technology surfaces. Some developers are excited because it nails something that is important to them. Some may not see an immediate benefit, and respond with caution. Then there is usually a percentage of the community that could be classed as "haters".

You are probably in the excited camp, or you have moved up from the cautious camp because you can see a use for this technology within your team. Your job is to get the developers on your team to move closer to the excited camp. Developers are usually logical beings with a dose of healthy scepticism.

### How to solve for it

Probably the most effective way that I have seen is to code up a simple prototype that replicates one piece of functionality from your current codebase. You can then setup a meeting with your team where you give everyone a walkthrough of the code. Talk about the new language and its benefits in a real life situation. Encourage questions and discussion.

If your project involves microservices, then you may be able to code up a replacement to one of the services. If you're team is working on an MVC web application, I would suggest coding up a full stack prototype with the new language, but only reproducing one simple feature from the existing codebase. When picking a feature from a large application, don't replicate things like user authentication. Just pick something that is core to the value that your application delivers to users.
