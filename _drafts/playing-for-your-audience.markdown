Over the years I've played in a few bands, our genre of music has generally been rock. Sometimes an interesting dynamic appears when a group of musicians are selecting songs to incorporate into their sets.

Music is very subjective. You may like Taylor Swift over Led Zeppelin, whereas I may prefer jazz. When it comes to music, we're generally all correct. We like what we like, and there is so much that forms our preferences over the years - life experiences, the year we were born, the city or part of the city we grew up in.

Musicians are an interesting bunch when it comes to their preferred music. They spend their time practising, deconstructing and studying music. There are bands that have great technical skills that usually gain them fans who are also musicians themselves. As musicians progress in skill, they tend to like more obscure music as they search for more challenging pieces to study and master.

When you're forming a cover band, your #1 objective should be: to make sure the audience has fun. If that means that the audience would love to get up and dance, playing prog rock or Stairway To Heaven is not going to achieve that goal. The problem is that musicians generally prefer the technical mastery of Stairway To Heaven as opposed to a song that has wider appeal and something that people can dance to (eg: Jessie's Girl). Musicians get sick of playing the same song, night in, night out, particularly when the song is not challenging to play.

* how does this apply to work stuff?
